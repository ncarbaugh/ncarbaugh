				<p> Hi my name is Noah Carbaugh and I live in the small town called Enola. I live hear with my parents and my 3 other siblings. We also have two dogs name Izzy and Chanel. I also hang out with my friends who are William, Coby, Anthony, Alex, Asa, Dom, and last but not least Clayton. We aslo hang out at Clayton's house the most. At Clayton house we usally play Smash Bros. Besides that we hang out at Deven's house and there we usally play board. The best thing we do is go to Adams Ricci Park and play volleyball. We also all play video games together. The game we are all currently playing is Destiny 2. I'm clearly the best because i'm the highest power level. I also help them with missions. Don't forget to add @cosmic1316 and @wadu_hek986 on snapchat.</p>
