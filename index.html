					<p>Come with me and let's go on a walk and explore my home town, Enola. Here everyone is friends and most people know each other. Here there is a lot of things to do. Like play sports or hang out at the pizza shop. My favorite thing to od is chill inside in my room playing video games with my friends. You could also take a long walk to see everything. Me and my friends hang out daily at the pizza shop.My favorite things to do are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li> Hang out with friends</li>
						<li> Stay inside and chill</li>
						<li> Go on walks</li>
						<li> Eat at the pizza shop</li>
					</ul>
